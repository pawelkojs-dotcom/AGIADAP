# INVARIANTS_AGI — Five Tests & Domain Invariants

## The Five Tests (must pass in every AGI doc)
1) **Two‑line law** is visible and correct.  
2) **Three fields** explicit and in correct places (σ/Θ in F; γ at ∂tσ).  
3) **Ecotone** defined operationally (gradients + thresholds).  
4) **Cross‑mapping** to universal theory present.  
5) **Falsifiability** (AR1–AR3) included.

## AGI Domain Invariants
- **I1:** No “γ in F” — γ is temporal metric only.  
- **I2:** Θ affects both F (−ΘS) and noise (√(2Θ)).  
- **I3:** σ is bounded and measurable (0–1 or normalized norm).  
- **I4:** Ecotone detection is thresholded and rankable.  
- **I5:** Release requires AR1/AR3 regression passing.
