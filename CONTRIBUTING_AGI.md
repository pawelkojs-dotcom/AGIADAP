# CONTRIBUTING_AGI — Workflow & Conventions

- Use **ADR** for every significant decision (copy `ADR_AGI_TEMPLATE.md`).
- Open CRs in `BACKLOG_AGI_CR.md`; keep OPEN ≤ 10.
- Every commit/section passes `INVARIANTS_AGI.md` (Five Tests).
- Keep files small; prefer references to duplication.
- Version with dates + SemVer; update ROADMAP on milestone completion.
