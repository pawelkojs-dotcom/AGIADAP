# Project Manifest - AGI ADAPTONIKA

## Mission
Operationalize intentionality as measurable emergence in artificial intelligence through adaptonic field theory.

## Core Innovation
Intentionality = Architectural property (n_eff > 4.5) + Sigma dynamics + Multi-session persistence

## Status
TRL 4.2 - Validated in toy models and real LLMs

## Key Results
- 5 layers mathematically necessary
- 100% success rate (Campaign #3)
- I_strength = 18.00 (procedure-breaking)
- 36% goal decay across sessions

## Theoretical Foundation
σ-Θ-γ dynamics unified with:
- Free Energy Principle
- World Models (JEPA)
- Universal AI (AIXI)
- Mechanistic Interpretability

## Empirical Evidence
3 campaigns, 50+ experiments, 200+ simulation runs
Reproducibility: 100% (20/20 replications)

## Code Base
Python implementations, validated metrics, production-ready v3.1
