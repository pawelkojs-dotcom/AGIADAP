# SAFETY_AGI — Safety & Governance Guidelines

- **Scope boundaries:** experiments stay within research tasks; no harmful content, no sensitive data.
- **Exploration controls (Θ):** cap Θ; use safe prompts and filters.
- **Damping controls (γ):** avoid pathological low γ in high‑risk tasks.
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop:** verify outputs; audit rationales in ecotones.
- **Logging:** keep audit logs for decisions (ADRs) and CRs.
- **Red‑teaming:** include stress tests for bias and instability.
