# Figures Description — Θ(ω) mHz Module Validation

## Figure 1 — Θ(ω) Spectrum
Plot: ReΘ(ω) and ImΘ(ω) vs frequency (log scale).
Highlight kink region (10⁻³–10⁻¹ Hz) and ω* where Θ ≈ T.

## Figure 2 — Kramers–Kronig Residuals
Display residuals after KK integration to verify analytical consistency.

## Figure 3 — Cross-Detector Coherence Map
Heatmap of |C_Θ(ω)| for LISA vs UK optical cavity.
Contours at coherence = 0.5, 0.8, 0.9.
