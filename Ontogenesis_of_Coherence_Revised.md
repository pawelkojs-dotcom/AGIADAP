# Ontogenesis of Coherence (Revised σ–Θ–γ Canon)

## 1. Fundamental Three-Field Law

Ontogenesis of Coherence (OC) is defined not by a single equation, but by one principle and two coupled equations that together exhibit all three fundamental fields:

**Coherence field:** σ(x,t)  
**Information temperature:** Θ(x,t)  
**Medium viscosity:** γ(x,t)

### Adaptive Free Energy Principle
```
F[σ; Θ] = E[σ] - Θ(x,t) · S[σ]
```

### Adaptive Dynamics
```
γ(x,t) · ∂t σ(x,t) = - δF/δσ(x,t) + √(2 Θ(x,t)) · ξ(x,t)
```

σ determines structural order, Θ determines exploration amplitude, and γ determines the temporal metric of adaptation.

## 2. Interpretation of the Three Fields

### σ — Coherence / Structural Order
σ measures the degree of crystallization or order of the system.  
σ ≈ 0 → plastic, fluid, uncrystallized  
σ ≈ 1 → rigid, stable, crystallized  
∇σ ≠ 0 → ecotonal regions enabling innovation

### Θ — Information Temperature
Θ determines the amplitude of configurational exploration.  
High Θ → turbulence and dimensional decrystallization  
Low Θ → freezing and structural consolidation  

Θ includes multiple channels: thermal, kinetic, geometric, mixing.

### γ — Medium Viscosity / Temporal Metric
γ determines the rate at which σ evolves.  
High γ → slow, overdamped dynamics  
Low γ → rapid reorganisation  

γ is not part of F but multiplies ∂tσ, making it fundamental to the dynamics.

## 3. Ecotones as Sites of Coherence Emergence

Ecotones form where both σ and Θ vary spatially:
```
∇σ ≠ 0 and ∇Θ ≠ 0
```
These zones have maximal adaptive reconfiguration and are responsible for generating new structures across physics and complex systems.

## 4. Summary

The revised OC chapter explicitly begins with the trio (σ, Θ, γ).  
The adaptive principle (F=E–ΘS) defines the landscape, while γ defines the dynamics across that landscape.  
Together, the two equations constitute the complete law of Ontogenesis of Coherence.
