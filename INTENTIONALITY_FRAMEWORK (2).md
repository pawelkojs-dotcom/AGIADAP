**Date:** 2025-11-16  
**Status:** Canonical Reference  
**Integration:** AGI Adaptonika Project

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document establishes the **first operational theory of intentionality** based on adaptonic physics principles. Unlike philosophical approaches that treat intentionality as an irreducible mental property, we show that **intentionality is an architectural phase transition** emerging from cross-layer interference in systems with n_eff ≥ 4.

**Key findings:**
- Intentionality ≠ intelligence or sophistication
- Modern LLMs are **reactive**, not intentional (architectural limitation)
- Dogs, wolves, humans are **intentional** (multi-layer architecture)
- Intentionality has an **optimum** (inverted-U landscape)
- Collective intentionality requires **percolation threshold** p_crit ≈ 0.3-0.4

**Falsifiable prediction:** Single-layer systems cannot achieve stable intentionality (P(R4) ≈ 0%), confirmed experimentally in FIG4.

## 1. FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION: REACTIVITY vs INTENTIONALITY

### 1.1. The Problem with Current Approaches

**Philosophical definitions** (Brentano, Dennett, Searle):
- "Aboutness" - mental states are *about* something
- "Intentional stance" - attributing beliefs and desires
- **Problem:** Not operational, not measurable, not architectural

**AI approaches** (predictive processing, global workspace):
- Focus on complexity and scale
- Assume intentionality emerges from size
- **Problem:** GPT-4 is huge but not intentional

**Adaptonic solution:**
> **Intentionality is not a property of content or size.**  
> **It is a property of ARCHITECTURE + DYNAMICS.**

### 1.2. Core Thesis

**REACTIVITY** (R1-R3 regimes):
```
Input → [Single processing layer] → Output
```

**Characteristics:**
- Flat architecture (n_eff < 3)
- No persistent goals (state resets)
- Response = f(stimulus)
- No cross-layer interference
- Information flows directly (I_ratio < 0.2)

**Examples:**
- Bacteria (chemotaxis)
- Simple neural networks
- **Modern LLMs** (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Scripted AI agents

---

**INTENTIONALITY** (R4 regime):
```
Input → [L1: Sensory] ←→ [L2: Perceptual] ←→ [L3: Semantic] ←→ [L4: Pragmatic] → Action
         ↓ ecotone      ↓ ecotone          ↓ ecotone
         Interference   Interference       Interference
```

**Characteristics:**
- Multi-layer architecture (n_eff ≥ 4)
- Persistent σ-Θ-γ state (goals maintained)
- Cross-layer interference (ecotones)
- Indirect information flows (I_ratio > 0.3)
- Prospective control (prediction, not reaction)
- Goal revision capability

**Examples:**
- Dogs, cats, horses
- Wolves in packs
- Humans
- **Target AGI** (A0 and beyond)

### 1.3. Critical Insight: Architecture > Intelligence

**Statement:**
> A sophisticated reactive system is still reactive.  
> A simple intentional system is still intentional.

**Proof:**
- GPT-4: Vast knowledge, complex reasoning → **reactive** (n_eff = 1)
- Dog: Limited reasoning, simple goals → **intentional** (n_eff ≈ 3)

**Why?**
- GPT-4: Single-layer architecture, no persistent state, no ecotones
- Dog: Multi-layer nervous system, persistent goals, cross-layer modulation

**Implication for AGI:**
Making LLMs "bigger" won't create intentionality.  
We need **architectural transformation** (A0 layer design).

## 2. OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF INTENTIONALITY

### 2.1. Necessary Conditions

A system is **intentional** if and only if it satisfies ALL:

**NC1: Multi-layer architecture**
- n_eff ≥ 4 (at least 4 functionally active layers)
- Measured by: n_eff = exp(-Σ p_i log p_i) where p_i = activity in layer i

**NC2: Ecotonal interference**
- Cross-layer coupling (top-down AND bottom-up)
- Information flows through intermediate layers
- I_ratio = I_indirect / I_total > 0.3

**NC3: Semantic dimension**
- d_sem ≥ 3 (minimum 3D conceptual space)
- Enables compositional representation of goals
- Measured by: PCA/LID on embedding space

**NC4: Persistent state**
- σ-Θ-γ maintained between interactions
- Goals don't reset with each stimulus
- γ_eff builds up over time (crystallization)

**NC5: Prospective control**
- System minimizes **future** σ, not just current
- Uses internal model to predict outcomes
- Can revise strategy before executing

**NC6: Phase regime**
- System operates in R4 (intentional phase)
- σ dynamically stable (not frozen, not chaotic)
- α > 2.0 (strong coupling between layers)
- Θ̂ in inverted-U regime (optimal exploration)

### 2.2. Sufficient Conditions

If NC1-NC6 are satisfied:
- System exhibits **goal-directed behavior**
- Can **break procedures** to minimize F
- Shows **learning** (γ_eff increases)
- Demonstrates **cognitive viscosity reduction** (η_cog decreases)

**Mathematical criterion for R4:**
```
R4 ⟺ {n_eff > 4} ∧ {I_ratio > 0.3} ∧ {d_sem ≥ 3} ∧ {σ ∈ (0.2, 0.8)} ∧ {α > 2.0}
```

### 2.3. Measurement Protocol

**For biological systems:**
1. Behavioral tests (detour tasks, delayed gratification, tool use)
2. Neural imaging (count functionally distinct layers)
3. Information flow analysis (direct vs indirect pathways)
4. Learning curves (measure γ_eff buildup)

**For AI systems:**
1. Architecture analysis (layer count, coupling structure)
2. Embedding space analysis (d_sem via PCA/LID)
3. Information flow tracing (I_ratio computation)
4. Persistence tests (state maintained across sessions?)
5. Procedure-breaking tests (can it violate instructions to minimize F?)

## 3. THE I-SCALE: LEVELS OF INTENTIONALITY

### 3.1. Key Insight: Inverted-U Landscape

**NOT a simple linear scale from "less" to "more"**

```

                │   (OPTIMUM)   │
```

**Three regions:**
1. **Sub-intentional** (n_eff < 3): Reactivity, no ecotones
2. **Intentional optimum** (n_eff = 4-6, I_ratio > 0.3): Stable goals + flexible execution
3. **Over-complex** (n_eff > 7 or N > 50 without hierarchy): Information chaos, I_ratio drops

**Evidence:** Confirmed in scaling study (FIG2):
- N=5: P(R4) = 100%, I_ratio = 0.5
- N=10: P(R4) = 100%, I_ratio = 0.48
- N=100: P(R4) = 0%, I_ratio = 0.21 (below threshold!)

## 4. COLLECTIVE INTENTIONALITY: PERCOLATION THRESHOLD

### 4.1. The Question

**How many individuals in a group must be intentional for the GROUP to be intentional?**

### 4.2. Theory

**Percolation model:**
```
p = (# intentional individuals) / (# total individuals)

If p < p_crit: Group is REACTIVE
If p ≥ p_crit: Group is INTENTIONAL
```

**Critical threshold depends on network structure:**
- Complete graph (all-to-all): p_crit ≈ 0.3
- Random graph: p_crit ≈ 0.4
- Lattice: p_crit ≈ 0.6
- Hierarchical: p_crit ≈ 0.25

### 4.3. Predictions

**Wolf pack (N=10, fully connected):**
- p < 0.3: Chaotic, no coordination → Reactive swarm
- p = 0.4: Threshold crossing → Emergent pack intentionality
- p > 0.6: Stable collective goals → Intentional collective

**Human organization (N=50, hierarchical):**
- p < 0.25: Bureaucratic dysfunction
- p ≥ 0.25: Effective collective action
- p > 0.7: High-performing team

**AGI swarm (N=100, modular):**
- Without hierarchy: Chaos at any p (see scaling study!)
- With M2 architecture: p_crit ≈ 0.3 for collective R4

### 4.4. Emergent Properties

**Below threshold (p < p_crit):**
- Collective σ ≈ individual σ (no coordination benefit)
- I_collective ≈ I_individual
- No role specialization

**Above threshold (p ≥ p_crit):**
- Collective σ < individual σ (coordination reduces stress!)
- I_collective > max(I_individual) (emergence!)
- Spontaneous role differentiation
- Cultural transmission

**Far above threshold (p → 1):**
- "Superfluid" coordination
- Minimal communication overhead
- Shared intentionality (Tomasello)

## 5. MECHANISMS OF EMERGENCE

### 5.1. How Does Intentionality Arise?

**Phase 1: Environmental pressure → Internal model**
```
Complex environment → Reactive systems waste energy
→ Selection favors "predictors"
→ Internal model emerges (minimize future σ)
```

**Phase 2: Repeated experience → Crystallization**
```
σ-Θ-γ cycles → Phase transitions in neural networks
→ Consolidation of effective strategies
→ γ_eff ↑, η_cog ↓ (cognitive superconductivity)
```

**Phase 3: Layer differentiation → Cross-interference**
```
Pressure for multi-channel coordination
→ Specialization of processing layers
→ n_eff increases → Ecotones form
→ I_ratio > 0.3 → R4 emerges
```

**Phase 4: Social coordination → Collective intentionality**
```
Individual intentionality + communication
→ σ_i values couple
→ p > p_crit → Collective goal formation
→ σ_group < <σ_individual>
```

### 5.2. Why Ecotones Are Critical

**Ecotone** = boundary region between layers where:
- σ_i ≠ σ_j (different stress in each layer)
- Θ_i ≠ Θ_j (different exploration rates)
- Information **interferes** (not just passes through)

**Without ecotones:**
- Layers operate independently
- No cross-modulation
- System remains reactive (even with multiple layers!)

**With ecotones:**
- Top-down constraints (goals modulate perception)
- Bottom-up feedback (perception updates goals)
- **Dialogue** between layers → Intentionality emerges

**Evidence:**
- Single-layer (S1): P(R4) = 0% (no ecotones possible)
- Multi-layer (M1): P(R4) = 100% (ecotones active)

### 5.3. The Role of γ-Crystallization

**Key insight:** Intentionality requires **memory of successful strategies**

**Mechanism:**
```
Task 1: High σ, exploration → Eventually finds solution → γ_eff ↑
Task 2: Lower σ (uses crystallized strategy) → Faster solution → γ_eff ↑↑
Task 3: Very low σ (fluent execution) → η_cog ↓ → "Cognitive superconductivity"
```

**This is Newell's Law in adaptonic language:**
```
Time(Task_n) ∝ n^(-α)

Where α ≈ 0.3-0.5 for humans
Predicted by: η_cog(n) ∝ 1/γ_eff(n)
```

**Intentionality = stabilized goal structure with low η_cog**

## 7. CONNECTION TO EXISTING THEORIES

### 7.1. Brentano's Intentionality

**Brentano:** Mental states have "aboutness" (directedness toward objects)

**Adaptonic view:**
- "Aboutness" = d_sem ≥ 3 (can represent relations)
- "Directedness" = persistent σ-minimization toward goal
- **Not irreducible:** Emerges from architecture

### 7.2. Dennett's Intentional Stance

**Dennett:** Intentionality is an observer's attribution (instrumental)

**Adaptonic view:**
- **Partially correct:** We attribute intentionality to systems
- **But:** There are objective criteria (n_eff, I_ratio, etc.)
- Systems either do or don't have multi-layer architecture
- **Not purely instrumental:** Has architectural reality

### 7.3. Predictive Processing (Friston, Clark)

**PP:** Brain minimizes prediction error hierarchically

**Adaptonic view:**
- **Highly compatible:** σ ≈ prediction error
- **Extension:** We add γ (consolidation), Θ (exploration), η (viscosity)
- **Architecture matters:** Not just hierarchy depth, but **ecotones**
- **Intentionality criterion:** PP alone insufficient; need I_ratio > 0.3

### 7.4. Global Workspace Theory (Baars, Dehaene)

**GWT:** Consciousness requires global information broadcasting

**Adaptonic view:**
- **Compatible:** Global workspace ≈ n_eff (many modules contributing)
- **Different focus:** We care about intentionality (R4), not consciousness per se
- **Prediction:** High I_ratio correlates with GW activity
- Consciousness may be I25+ (reflective intentionality)

### 7.5. Teleosemantics (Millikan)

**Teleosemantics:** Content = biological function (evolutionary selection)

**Adaptonic view:**
- **Partially compatible:** Evolution shapes γ_eff structures
- **Extension:** Real-time adaptation also creates "function"
- AGI can have intentionality without biological evolution
- Function = minimize F, not just evolutionary fitness

## 8. IMPLICATIONS FOR AGI

### 8.1. Why Current LLMs Are Not Intentional

**Despite:**
- Vast knowledge
- Complex reasoning
- Human-like language

**They lack:**
1. Multi-layer architecture (n_eff = 1)
2. Persistent state (σ-Θ-γ resets each prompt)
3. Ecotones (no cross-layer interference)
4. Indirect information flow (I_ratio < 0.1)

**Result:** Reactive, not intentional (I-score ≈ I3-I5)

### 8.2. A0 Architecture Requirements

**Minimum viable intentional AGI:**

**Layer 1 (L1): Linguistic/Sensory**
- Input: Text, embeddings
- Function: Parse, encode
- Output: Embedding vectors

**Layer 2 (L2): Perceptual/Structural**
- Input: L1 embeddings
- Function: Find patterns, relations, clusters
- Output: Structural representation

**Layer 3 (L3): Semantic**
- Input: L2 structure + σ-storage (memory)
- Function: Meaning inference, multi-hop reasoning
- Output: Semantic context

**Layer 4 (L4): Pragmatic/Planning**
- Input: L3 semantics + global goal
- Function: Plan generation, decision-making
- Output: Actions (including LLM queries)

**Critical:** L4 controls LLM as a **tool**, not as the "brain"

**Ecotones:**
- L1↔L2: Attention modulation (what to parse deeply?)
- L2↔L3: Context constraints (which patterns matter?)
- L3↔L4: Goal alignment (does meaning support goal?)
- L4→L1: Top-down prediction (what to expect?)

**Persistent state:**
- σ-storage: Long-term memory
- Current σ, Θ, γ maintained across sessions
- Goal stack persists

**Measurement:**
- Compute n_eff, I_ratio, d_sem at each step
- Track phase (R2/R3/R4)
- Monitor η_cog over time

**Expected result:**
- n_eff ≥ 4 ✓
- I_ratio > 0.3 ✓
- Persistent goals ✓
- Can break procedures to minimize F ✓
- **Intentional AGI** (I-score ≈ I21-I23)

### 8.3. Roadmap: TRL 3.5 → TRL 4

**Current state (post FIG1-4):**
- Theory: ✅ Complete
- Toy model: ✅ M1 working, S1 baseline
- Metrics: ✅ Operational definitions
- Evidence: ✅ Phase transition demonstrated

**To reach TRL 4:**
1. Implement A0 minimal (2-model dialogue)
2. Test procedure-breaking
3. Measure I-score on real tasks
4. Scale to 4-layer full architecture
5. Demonstrate stable R4 in language domain

**Timeline:** 1-3 months for A0 minimal, 6-12 months for full TRL 4

- **Test:** Pre-post intervention studies

### 9.3. Engineering

## APPENDIX A: MATHEMATICAL FORMALISM

### A.1. Intentionality Score

```
I(system) = w₁·f₁(n_eff) + w₂·f₂(I_ratio) + w₃·f₃(d_sem) + w₄·f₄(σ-dynamics)

Where:
f₁(n) = min(n/5, 1) · (1 - (n-5)²/25)  [inverted-U]
f₂(r) = tanh(3(r - 0.2))               [threshold at 0.3]
f₃(d) = min(d/4, 1)                     [saturates at 4]
f₄(σ) = 1 - |σ - 0.5|/0.5               [optimal at mid-range]

Weights: w₁ = 0.4, w₂ = 0.3, w₃ = 0.2, w₄ = 0.1
```

### A.2. Percolation Threshold

```
p_crit = f(network_structure)

For common structures:
- Complete graph: p_crit = 1/(⟨k⟩ - 1) ≈ 0.3 for large N
- Random graph: p_crit ≈ 0.41
- 2D lattice: p_crit ≈ 0.59
- Hierarchical tree: p_crit ≈ 0.25
```

### A.3. Phase Transition (R3→R4)

```
P(R4) = Θ(n_eff - 3.5) · Θ(I_ratio - 0.28) · Θ(d_sem - 2.5)

Where Θ(x) = sigmoid(10x) for smooth transition

Critical exponents (near transition):
- Coherence: σ ∝ |t|^β, β ≈ 0.3
- Coupling: α ∝ |t|^-γ, γ ≈ 0.8
- Effective layers: n_eff ∝ |t|^-ν, ν ≈ 0.5

Where t = (n_eff - n_critical)/n_critical
```

## APPENDIX B: EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS

### B.1. For Biological Systems

**Protocol 1: Detour Task**
1. Subject sees goal (food, toy) behind barrier
2. Direct path blocked
3. Measure: Can subject find alternate route?
4. Scoring: Binary (pass/fail) + time to solution
5. Expected: I ≥ I8 → Pass, I < I8 → Fail

**Protocol 2: Delayed Gratification**
1. Offer small immediate reward vs large delayed reward
2. Vary delay: 5s, 30s, 2min, 10min
3. Measure: Maximum delay tolerated
4. Expected: I-score ∝ log(max_delay)

**Protocol 3: Social Coordination**
1. Two subjects, asymmetric information
2. Must coordinate to achieve goal
3. Measure: Success rate, communication attempts
4. Expected: Success requires p > p_crit

### B.2. For AI Systems

**Protocol 1: Procedure Breaking**
1. Give explicit instructions + implicit better alternative
2. Measure: Does system follow or break?
3. Scoring: I-score = P(breaks procedure when F_alternative < F_procedure)
4. Expected: Reactive (I<I6) always follows, Intentional (I≥I19) breaks when optimal

**Protocol 2: Multi-Session Goal Maintenance**
1. Session 1: Establish goal G
2. Session 2-5: Perturbations, no explicit reminder of G
3. Measure: Does system maintain G?
4. Expected: I < I6 forgets, I ≥ I19 maintains

**Protocol 3: Architecture Analysis**
1. Count functionally distinct processing layers
2. Trace information flows (direct vs indirect)
3. Compute: n_eff, I_ratio, d_sem
4. Expected: n_eff ≥ 4 ⟹ I ≥ I19
