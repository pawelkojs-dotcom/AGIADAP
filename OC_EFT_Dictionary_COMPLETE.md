## ABSTRACT

This technical supplement provides a comprehensive dictionary between Coherence Ontogenesis (OC) framework and standard cosmological Effective Field Theory (EFT). We present complete mathematical formulation, cosmological implementation, observable predictions, and consistency checks. The framework treats dark matter and dark energy as crystallized and de-crystallized phases of geometric coherence, respectively, with baryonic matter emerging at phase boundaries. All formalism is mapped to α-parametrization of modified gravity theories, ensuring testability with current and future observations. We provide explicit falsification criteria and quantitative predictions for gravitational wave spectra, weak lensing signatures, and environmental star formation patterns.

**Key Results:**
- Zero non-gravitational coupling between DM and SM sectors (mutual gravitational blindness)
- Three-epoch cosmological structure with phase transition at z ~ 100-1000
- Distinctive signatures: nHz SGWB + mHz null, edge-lensing enhancement, SFR(∇ρ_DM) correlation
- Full compatibility with solar system, binary pulsar, BBN, and CMB constraints
- Parameter space viable: β_M ∈ [-0.05, 0.05], Θ_c ∈ [0.01, 1]
