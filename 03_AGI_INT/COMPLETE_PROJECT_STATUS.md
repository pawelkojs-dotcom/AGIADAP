| Reproducibility | >90% | 100% | ✅ Perfect |

## Outstanding Questions

### High Priority:
1. Can we predict exact t_R4 from initial conditions?
2. What is optimal γ(N) for N>100?
3. How does 6th layer affect intentionality/safety?

### Medium Priority:
4. Sigma field topology in high dimensions?
5. Transfer learning across different tasks?
6. Quantitative consciousness metrics?

### Research Questions:
7. Multi-agent collective intelligence emergence?
8. Alignment via direct σ-control?
9. Biological neural networks comparison?
