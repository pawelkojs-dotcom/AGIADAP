# Adaptive Coupling - The Missing Piece

## Problem (v2.0)
Fixed coupling caused destabilization at high sigma.

## Solution (v3.1)
Adaptive coupling: lambda_eff = lambda_0 * (1 + alpha * sigma^2)

## Results
- n_eff recovery: 4.67 to 4.98
- Stability: 100% (no crashes)
- R4 success: 100%

## Why It Works
High coherence strengthens layer connections.
System self-regulates coupling strength.
Natural response to consensus formation.

Status: Axiom VI validated empirically.
