  "plan": "I'd be happy to help you develop a meditation practice that can lead to vipassana (insight meditation). Here's a structured approach:\n\n## Foundation Stage (Weeks 1-4)\n**Start with Samatha (Concentration)**\n- Begin with 10-15 minutes daily\n- Focus on breath awareness at the nostrils\n- When mind wanders, gently return to breath\n- Establish consistent time and quiet space\n- Goal: Develop basic concentration and mindfulness\n\n## Developing Stage (Weeks 5-12)\n**Expand Awareness**\n- Increase to 20-30 minutes\n- Practice noting: mentally label experiences as \"thinking,\" \"feeling,\" \"hearing\"\n- Observe physical sensations throughout the body\n- Notice the arising and passing of experiences\n- Begin body scanning meditation\n\n## Vipassana Integration (Month 3+)\n**Insight Practice**\n- 30-45 minutes sessions\n- Observe the three characteristics:\n  - **Impermanence**: How all experiences arise and pass away\n  - **Suffering**: The unsatisfactory nature of clinging\n  - **Non-self**: The absence of a fixed, permanent self\n\n## Daily Structure\n1. **Sitting meditation** (main practice)\n2. **Walking meditation** (5-10 minutes)\n3. **Mindful daily activities** (eating, washing, etc.)\n\n## Key Tips\n- Be patient and gentle with yourself\n- Consider attending a retreat or finding a qualified teacher\n- Read foundational texts (like those by S.N. Goenka or Joseph Goldstein)\n- Join a meditation group for support\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these stages or discuss specific techniques?",
