  "plan": "Here's a comprehensive dividend investing strategy for Financial Independence (FI):\n\n## Core Strategy Framework\n\n### **1. Foundation Building (Years 1-3)**\n- **Target allocation**: 70% broad market index funds, 30% dividend-focused\n- **Priority**: Build emergency fund (6-12 months expenses) first\n- **Focus**: High-quality dividend ETFs for diversification\n  - VTI (Total Stock Market) or VOO (S&P 500)\n  - VYM (Vanguard High Dividend Yield)\n  - SCHD (Schwab US Dividend Equity)\n\n### **2. Dividend Criteria for Individual Stocks**\n**Quality Metrics:**\n- Dividend yield: 2-6% (avoid yield traps >8%)\n- Payout ratio: <60% for most sectors, <80% for utilities/REITs\n- Consecutive years of increases: 10+ years preferred\n- Debt-to-equity: <0.5 in most cases\n- Free cash flow coverage: 1.5x+ dividend payments\n\n### **3. Portfolio Allocation by FI Stage**\n\n**Early Stage (0-40% to FI):**\n- 60% Growth/Total market\n- 25% Dividend growth stocks\n- 15% High-yield/REITs\n\n**Mid Stage (40-70% to FI):**\n- 40% Growth/Total market  \n- 40% Dividend growth stocks\n- 20% High-yield/REITs\n\n**Late Stage (70%+ to FI):**\n- 25% Growth/Total market\n- 50% Dividend growth stocks\n- 25% High-yield/REITs/Bonds\n\n### **4. Sector Diversification**\n- **Consumer Staples**: 15-20% (KO, PG, JNJ)\n- **Utilities**: 10-15% (NEE, D, SO)\n- **Technology**: 15-20% (MSFT, AAPL, ABBV)\n- **Financials**: 10-15% (JPM, V, MA)\n- **REITs**: 10-15% (VNQ, O, REIT)\n- **Healthcare**: 10-15% (JNJ, ABBV, MRK)\n- **Other sectors**: 10-15%\n\n### **5. Implementation Strategy**\n\n**Monthly Actions:**\n- Invest consistently regardless of market conditions\n- Reinvest dividends during accumulation phase\n- Rebalance quarterly if allocations drift >5%\n\n**Annual Reviews:**\n- Assess dividend sustainability\n- Review payout ratios and business fundamentals\n- Trim positions that cut/suspend dividends\n- Add to positions showing strong growth\n\n### **6. Tax Optimization**\n- Hold dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts when possible\n- Use taxable accounts for qualified dividend payers\n- Consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts\n- Factor in your marginal tax rate vs. capital gains rate\n\n### **7. Red Flags to Avoid**\n- Yield >8% without strong justification\n- Declining revenue/earnings trends\n- Payout ratio >100%\n- High debt levels in cyclical industries\n- Recent dividend cuts or suspensions\n\n### **8. FI Transition Strategy**\n**5 years before FI:**\n- Begin shifting to higher-yielding positions\n- Build dividend income to cover 25-40% of expenses\n- Consider individual bonds/CDs for stability\n\n**At FI:**\n- Target dividend income covering 50-75% of expenses\n- Maintain some growth allocation for inflation protection\n- Create systematic withdrawal plan for non-dividend investments\n\n### **Sample Target Dividend Income**\nIf you need $50,000/year in FI:\n- Target $30,000 from dividends (60%)\n- $20,000 from other sources (withdrawal/bonds)\n- Requires ~$750,000-$1M in dividend-paying investments at 3-4% yield\n\n**Key Success Factors:**\n- Consistency over market timing\n- Focus on dividend growth, not just yield\n- Maintain diversification\n- Regular monitoring without over-trading\n- Patience for compound growth\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this strategy or help you adapt it to your particular situation?",
