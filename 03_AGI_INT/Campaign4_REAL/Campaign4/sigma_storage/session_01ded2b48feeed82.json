  "goal": "Finish PhD thesis on intentional AI systems",
  "plan": "I'd be happy to help you structure your PhD thesis on intentional AI. Here's a suggested framework that balances theoretical depth with practical considerations:\n\n## Suggested Thesis Structure\n\n### 1. Introduction (15-20 pages)\n- **Problem Statement**: Define intentionality in AI and why it matters\n- **Research Questions**: What specific aspects of intentional AI are you investigating?\n- **Scope & Limitations**: Boundaries of your research\n- **Contributions**: Novel insights, frameworks, or methodologies\n- **Thesis Outline**: Roadmap for readers\n\n### 2. Literature Review & Theoretical Foundations (40-50 pages)\n- **Philosophy of Mind**: Intentionality from Brentano to contemporary theories\n- **AI & Cognitive Science**: Current approaches to modeling intentional states\n- **Machine Learning**: Relevant architectures (attention mechanisms, goal-oriented RL, etc.)\n- **Gaps in Current Research**: What your thesis addresses\n\n### 3. Conceptual Framework (30-40 pages)\n- **Defining Intentional AI**: Your working definition and criteria\n- **Theoretical Model**: How intentionality emerges/is implemented in AI systems\n- **Measurement & Evaluation**: How to assess intentionality in AI\n\n### 4-5. Core Research Chapters (2-3 chapters, 40-50 pages each)\nThese depend on your specific focus. Possible approaches:\n- **Computational Implementation**: Novel architectures for intentional AI\n- **Empirical Studies**: Experiments demonstrating intentional behavior\n- **Case Studies**: Analysis of existing systems through your framework\n- **Applications**: Specific domains (robotics, NLP, game AI, etc.)\n\n### 6. Discussion & Implications (25-35 pages)\n- **Synthesis**: How your findings connect\n- **Broader Implications**: For AI development, ethics, philosophy\n- **Limitations**: Honest assessment of constraints\n- **Future Directions**: Research trajectories your work opens\n\n### 7. Conclusion (10-15 pages)\n- **Summary of Contributions**\n- **Answers to Research Questions**\n- **Final Reflections**\n\n## Key Questions to Refine Your Structure:\n\n1. **What's your specific angle?** (computational, philosophical, empirical, application-focused?)\n2. **What type of intentionality?** (beliefs/desires, goal-directedness, semantic content, consciousness?)\n3. **What's your methodology?** (theoretical analysis, experiments, system development, case studies?)\n4. **What's your disciplinary home?** (CS, philosophy, cognitive science, interdisciplinary?)\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any section or help you adapt this structure based on your specific research focus and approach?",
