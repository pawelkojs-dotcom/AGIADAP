## Abstract

We present **CR4**, a falsifiable relation linking the cosmological run of the effective Planck mass to potential variations of fundamental constants within a metric-compatible scalar–tensor framework. A weak, gauge-invariant coupling between a cosmological coherence field **σ** and the Standard-Model Higgs sector induces correlated, redshift-dependent drifts of the proton-to-electron mass ratio **μ ≡ mₚ/mₑ** and the fine-structure constant **α\_EM**. From the Jordan-frame action with \(M_*^2(σ)\) and a suppressed Higgs mass deformation, we derive the master formulae
\[
\frac{Δμ}{μ}(z) = -\,c_μ \int_{0}^{z}\frac{α_M(z′)}{1+z′}\,dz′,\qquad
\frac{Δα_{EM}}{α_{EM}}(z) \simeq -\,c_α \int_{0}^{z}\frac{α_M(z′)}{1+z′}\,dz′,
\]
with \(α_M \equiv d\ln M_*^2/d\ln a\) and \(c_μ, c_α\) set by a small σ–Higgs coupling. We implement a numerically stable solver for σ(z), validate an integral–differential consistency check at <1% error, and confront CR4 with current quasar absorption constraints on Δμ/μ (≲10⁻⁵ at z~2) and equivalence-principle bounds, obtaining \(|β_H| ≲ 3×10^{-4}\) (95% CL for natural suppression scales). Forecasts show that ELT (Δα/α≈10⁻⁶) and SKA Phase 2 (Δμ/μ≈10⁻⁷) can decisively test the predicted correlated drifts in 2027–2035. CR4 complements gravitational consistency relations (GW siren friction, void/cluster lensing contrast, edge-enhanced convergence), closing a multi-domain program to falsify metric-compatible scalar–tensor scenarios with an evolving Planck mass.
