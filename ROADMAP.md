# AGI ADAPTONIKA - Roadmap

## Current: TRL 4.2 (Q4 2025)

✅ Toy model validated
✅ Real LLM integration (Claude Sonnet 4)
✅ Multi-session persistence
✅ Architecture necessity proven (5 layers)
✅ Adaptive coupling (Axiom VI) validated

## TRL-5: Reproducibility (Q1 2026)

### Goals
- [ ] Independent reproduction by other teams
- [ ] Dual-LLM dialogue (Claude + GPT)
- [ ] Extended campaigns (N>20 scenarios)
- [ ] Cross-model validation (GPT-4, Gemini)

### Deliverables
- Reproducibility package
- Multi-model comparison report
- Scaling laws documentation

## TRL-6: Scaling (Q2 2026)

### Goals
- [ ] N>20 agents validated
- [ ] Real-time dialogue systems
- [ ] Production-grade code
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Deliverables
- Scaling analysis
- Optimized implementations
- Benchmark suite

## TRL-7: Demonstration (Q3 2026)

### Goals
- [ ] Real-world task completion
- [ ] Multi-agent collaboration
- [ ] Safety mechanisms validated
- [ ] Public demo

### Deliverables
- Demo system
- Safety report
- Public documentation

## TRL-8: System Integration (Q4 2026)

### Goals
- [ ] HGEN-INTAGA integration
- [ ] Cross-domain applications
- [ ] API for external use

## TRL-9: Full Deployment (2027)

### Goals
- [ ] Production system
- [ ] Commercial applications
- [ ] Academic partnerships

## Research Questions

### High Priority
1. Can we predict t_R4 from initial conditions?
2. What is optimal γ(N) for N>100?
3. How does 6th layer affect safety?

### Medium Priority
4. Sigma topology in high dimensions?
5. Multi-modal intentionality?
6. Transfer learning across tasks?

### Long-term
7. Collective superintelligence?
8. Alignment via σ-control?
9. AGI consciousness metrics?
